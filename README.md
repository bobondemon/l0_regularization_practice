Learn how to use L0 regularization

The CIFAR10 training part including model structure and dataloader are modified from [TUTORIAL 4: INCEPTION, RESNET AND DENSENET](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/course_UvA-DL/04-inception-resnet-densenet.html). I just refactored to [hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) and [lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) format.
